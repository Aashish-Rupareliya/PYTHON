File Functions in Python
In Python, file functions are used to create, read, write, and manipulate files. The built-in open() function is used to open a file. The mode parameter in the open() function specifies what you want to do with the file:

'r' - Read (default)
'w' - Write (will truncate the file if it exists)
'a' - Append
'b' - Binary mode
't' - Text mode (default)
